## üïπÔ∏è Introduction to Roblox

![Roblox Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Roblox_Logo_2022.svg/512px-Roblox_Logo_2022.svg.png)

Roblox is a popular online platform that allows users to create, share, and play games created by others. Built with **creativity in mind**, Roblox games are scripted primarily using **Lua**, a lightweight and efficient programming language.

## üíª Understanding Lua Scripting

![Lua Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Lua-Logo.svg)

Lua is a **powerful, fast, and easy-to-learn scripting language** widely used in Roblox for game development. With Lua, developers can:
- Build complex game mechanics üõ†Ô∏è
- Customize player interactions üéØ
- Create interactive environments üåç

## üéØ What Is Script Injection?

Script injection is a technique where unauthorized Lua scripts are executed within a Roblox game. This is often achieved by:
1. **Exploiting vulnerabilities** in the game or engine.
2. **Injecting custom code** to modify in-game behavior.

Common purposes:
- Automating gameplay (e.g., auto-farming).
- Unlocking restricted content.
- Manipulating other players' experiences.

> **Disclaimer:** This repository is for educational purposes only. Misuse of script injection violates Roblox's terms of service and is unethical. üö®

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üîç Components of a Script Injection:
1. **Exploit Tools**:
   Tools like [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to) or [Krnl](https://krnl.place/) are often used for executing scripts.
   
2. **Script Loader**:
   Injectors allow loading and executing scripts into the Roblox game client.

3. **Custom Lua Scripts**:
   Example of a simple Lua injection script:
   ```lua
   local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
   player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 100 -- Modify player speed
